# Deprecated Datetime Fix

This file documents the deprecated datetime usage fix applied by AICA E2E System Test.

## Issue

Python's `datetime.utcnow()` and `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()` are deprecated since Python 3.12.

## Solution

Replace deprecated methods with timezone-aware alternatives:

```python
# Before (deprecated)
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.utcnow()

# After (recommended)
from datetime import datetime, timezone
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
```

## Changes Applied

- Identified deprecated datetime usage patterns
- Replaced with timezone-aware datetime objects
- Updated test execution date: 2025-12-18
